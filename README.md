# Shrimp Quality Classification using Hybrid Machine Learning Models
This project focuses on developing a hybrid machine learning model to classify shrimp quality as either "Good" or "Bad" based on environmental and transport data. The model combines the strengths of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM classifiers to achieve reliable predictions.

# Key Features
Dataset: A shrimp quality dataset, including variables like environmental factors and transport type (Air Conditioned or Open Air).
Models Used:
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
SVM
Hybrid Approach: Averages probabilities from the three models to form an ensemble, improving overall accuracy.
Performance Highlights:
Gradient Boosting: 99.4% accuracy
Random Forest: 98.95% accuracy
SVM: 78.05% accuracy
Hybrid Model: 98.5% accuracy

# Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Handled encoding of categorical variables.
Performed train-test split with stratification for balanced evaluation.
Model Training
